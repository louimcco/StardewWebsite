    <h3>Score: 4.8</h3>
    <p>Haley is known to have a negative reputation, on Stardew Valley, as being a particularly judgemental character. <br> This means her quality of dialogue scores low as you feel insecure and unmotivated after a converstaion with her. <br> Her favourite items can be difficult to obtain, she is a fussy character. <br> One of her redeaming qualities is the summery look of her character art, bumping her score to 4.8 </p>

    <h3>Score: 7.2</h3>
    <p>Shane is certainly a character that requires patience from the player. <br> However, once you gain friendship with Shane some heartwarming scenes will follow. <br> Therefore, Shane's quality of dialogue is rated high. <br> His item rating is above average, beer is easy to obtain from the stardrop saloon, though it comes with a guilt factor. <br> His art is mid level, fairly boring to look at giving him an overall score of 7.2. </p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Score 4.2</h3>
    <p>Mayor Lewis is certainly a much more difficult character to rate. <br> He has a wide range of flaws and redeeming qualities as he is such a prominent figure in the village. <br> I would give his dialogue rating a low score personally, he is repetitive due to how often you must talk to him, in events etc. <br> He is also known to sneak onto your farm in the dead of night every night and steal from your bins <br> In terms of favourite items, Lewis is a man of many pleasures, with chilli peppers beig one of the most accessible. <br> Finally, you have to give credit to the character art, Mayor Lewis is adorned with a very diverse range of facial expressions.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Score 8.4</h3>
        <p>Continuing on a completely un<abbr title="entirely based upon personal experience and not objective fact">bias</abbr>ed note, we have the fabulous Marnie. <br> Given, the quality of Marnie's dialogue does leave something to be desired, but it is always a wholesome experience. She is the closest villager to your farm, keeps your livestock alive in the winter and is always truly happy to see you! <br> In terms of favourite items, Marnie is quite satisfied with a single large egg, making her the perfect villager for the chicken rancher. <br> Her character art is warm autumnal colours that really embody the cosy town feeling of the game. <br> Marnie we love you.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Score 9.2</h3>
        <p>Sewer rat <br> Krobus is one of the more mysterious characters on Stardew Valley, with his introduction being fairly late in the game. <br> He is a misjudged soul and is a beautiful embodiemont of the slimy, introvert that lives inside us all. <br> Krobus' dialogue is beautiful and culturally fulfilling. <br> His likes are akin to the legend that he is, ranging from refined quartz to gold bars. <br> Finally, his character art has a simple, majestic beauty that deserves nothing but the highest praise! </p>
